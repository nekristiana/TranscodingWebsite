    Seidi Ruder made the protest poster in a time of wide protests<br> in Netherlands (~1975-1985), which were directly linked to opposition against <br>first steps of centralized data collection of dutch citizents in a governmental level. <br><br><br>
    The transcoding project investigates not only the visual history of the time <br>in Netherlands, but also the connection with the topic of the protest poster in <br>a contemporary surveillance context of 2020. <br><br><br>
    The color pixels assembling (dissembling) the image is used to <br> camoflague the information with the information itself, like Seidi Ruder does <br> it in his poster (hiding the woman behind the numbers themselves).<br><br><br>
